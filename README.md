### Note when running the test to connect to an email using IMAP:
- Configuration on your email:
    + Enable IMAP access in your email settings.
    + If 2-factor authentication (2FA) is enabled, use an App password to authenticate instead of your regular password.
    + Ensure you update the email and password in the code to match your own credentials before running the test.

    This ensures that the IMAP connection works correctly and securely when you run the code.
